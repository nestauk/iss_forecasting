#  :chart_with_upwards_trend: Anticipating trends in impact investing

**_Exploring predictive analytics and causal inference methods_**

## :wave: Welcome!

This was an exploratory project led by Nesta's [Discovery Hub](https://www.nesta.org.uk/project/discovery-hub/), to trial methods for anticipating future trends in venture capital investment into startups. We are especially interested in startups working on solutions relevant to Nestaâ€™s missions, for example, green tech, food tech and early years education.

### :books: Read the blogs
We have described the results of this exploration in the following Medium articles:
- [Predicting start-up success using machine learning](https://medium.com/discovery-at-nesta/predicting-start-up-success-using-machine-learning-f3f53871bd22)
- [Causal inference for discerning the impact of research grants on company success](https://medium.com/discovery-at-nesta/causal-inference-634fe782e00c)


### :floppy_disk: Datasets
The input dataset unfortunately contains proprietary data from the Crunchbase database, which is why it can't be shared openly. However,the [Gateway to Research](https://gtr.ukri.org/) and [BEIS/Nesta R&D spatial data](https://access-research-development-spatial-data.beis.gov.uk/) are openly accessible.

You can also [see here the scripts](https://github.com/nestauk/innovation_sweet_spots/tree/dev/innovation_sweet_spots/pipeline/pilot/investment_predictions) used for joining up the three datasets, and preparing them for the prediction model and causal inference.

### :hammer: Analysis code

You will find [here the code notebooks](https://github.com/nestauk/iss_forecasting/tree/dev/iss_forecasting/analysis/company_level) used for both supervised machine learning and causal inference analysis.

We aim to implement these analyses into our future projects, whereas this repo will likely stay here as a reference.

## Setup

- Meet the data science cookiecutter [requirements](http://nestauk.github.io/ds-cookiecutter/quickstart), in brief:
  - Install: `git-crypt`, `direnv`, and `conda`
  - Have a Nesta AWS account configured with `awscli`
- Run `brew install cmake` to install CMake (needed to install LightGBM)
- Run `brew install libomp` to install OpenMP (needed to install LightGBM)
- Run `make install` to configure the development environment:
  - Setup the conda environment
  - Configure pre-commit
  - Configure metaflow to use AWS
- Run `make inputs-pull` to download inputs from S3
- Run `aws s3 sync s3://iss-forecasting/outputs/` to download outputs from S3
- Run `brew install graphviz` and `conda install -c conda-forge pygraphviz`
  to install graphviz to be able to visualise the causal graph when using DoWhy
